title:  "The crying child"
---

had a long day at work today yet again, it's 2am and i just came home from a work crunch. i'm exhausted af, but i don't want to sleep--a case of revenge bedtime procrastination.

i had planned to veg out and watch some netflix, not much else i can do rn in my state of mind. Buuuuut the power went out.

You never notice how much noise we drown in daily until its gone. cars honking in the morning, people partying in the evening and the ever present hum of the refrigerator piercing through the silence at night. but there's none of that. The loudest things here are my breath, my heartbeat, my thoughts,... and the sound of a child crying in the distance

Hungry, i get up to eat smth when i notice a small pale figure clinging at my leg. a quiet child, as pale as the moon and with tears on his face. i'd be startled if not for the warm sense of familiarity i feel towards him

"who are you?" i ask. he starts weeping again. "oh, i'm so sorry. it's going to be alright" i go down, pick him up and console him, holding back my own tears not knowing why.

he cries for a while and i continue to comfort him. slowly the crying gets quieter until he falls asleep in my arms. i'm stuck here wondering where he came from. who is he?

a few minutes pass, then he looks at me and asks "why don't you ever love me?"
"what?" i ask confusedly

"you never listen to me! and you never come around to play! You Don't Love Me!" he says as he almost starts to cry again

"no no no. i do love you" i interrupt, not being sure if i'm comforting him or if i actually do. for a kid i feel this fondly for; i'm surprised i still can't remember where i saw him

"really?"

"yes. really!"

his eyes open in wonder, then he hugs me tightly and giggles as he quickly falls asleep again. it's too late to go out find his parents, the internet isn't working and both of us want sleep

next morning i wake up, and the kid is gone. must've been a dream, but it doesnt feel that way. i feel lighter, like i've cried away all my pains and then laughed till my stomach hurt.

i go about my day, but things seem different. a little out of place. a little more vibrant. i keep getting lucky accidents and everyone seems more playful and friendly. work is as demanding as usual, but it can wait for tomorrow. i leave on time knowing that i need rest and play. maybe i might get to see that kid outside of work, a part of me wants to, i definitely want to

went to the farmers market on the way home to buy some fresh ingredients for my favourite meal. 90% of good cooking is just having fresh ingredients! something often sacrificed by industrial fast food joints for profits, and sacrificed by people in the name of convenience. people disregard and disrespect themselves in such subtle ways and then wonder why they are tired and depressed

come home, take a shower (always such a delightful part of the day) and start cooking. while refreshed and awake i hear him. "I LOVE THAT SMELL!" he says giddily while sitting on the kitchen counter, "This is going to taste so good!"

he seems healthier and older now. almost looks like a different kid but there's no mistaking this sense of familiarity and fondness.

"Yeah, its going to taste so good! i got some fresh ingredients. no more left over take away food" :)

he laughs and helps me get the food ready.

"Who are you?" i ask not being able to hold it in

he smiles and says "I'm the child in you"
