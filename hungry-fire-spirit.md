title:  "The hungry fire spirit"
---

It was a cold world. It was a dark world. It was a harsh world. 

People lived in cold suffering afraid of whatever beast or monster would emerge from the dark to feast on their flesh

One day people found fire. It provided them with warmth, a small refuge from the cold. They would feed it hay and twigs for it to grow

The flame grew, each day providing them with more warmth. It grew large enough to scare the demons away from where its holy light shined

The people would gather around, seeking the fire's warmth and protection. As all people do

And as all people do, they would tell of stories when they were gathered around the fire. Stories of close encounters with beasts. Fears of death. Hopes for the future. And the usual gossip of who's shagging who. I hear that the chief has been getting it on with a new maiden lately.

The fire sits there. Watching as it feeds on its fuel. Growing both in size and curiousity

One day, the fire spirit spoke. As all young children. It could only babble. The people could not understand the crackling of the flames. It was an attempt at communication, but it fell on unknowing ears

As the fire spirit grew, it learned its first word. One uttered around it plenty as people offered it food. 

"warm" it said

The people ignored it, they thought someone was providing an offering to the fire spirit

 "Warm" it said. Growing hungry

The people looked around. What bafoon would talk to the fire spirit in such a growling manner as they offered it food and asked for prayer?! Such disrespect.

But there was no one at the fire. Only the fire spirit itself

"Warm!" The young fire spirit cried, imitating a young child as it broke out into tears

The people were amazed. The holy fire spirit spoke! They hastily got whatever wood they could get and tossed it into the flame. How could they not? After all the wamth and safety the flame had provided them. The world was still a cold dark harsh place. But not around the holy fire spirit. People all over would pilgrimage to taste its warmth and safety

It was an amazing act. The holy fire spirit *spoke*. The holy spirit that provided such warmth and safety

But it was still an infant. It only new how to say "Warm" for food. It was still developing

Regardless. The people could not help but watch the fire spirit closely. They had never seen it speak before

They would sit around the fire and watch it as all people would. And tell of their stories. There had been fewer beasts as the holy fire had kept them away. Its holy protection provided them with more safe time and space to scavenge, making the bounties plentiful and the people healthy. And I hear that the chief is having his 4th kid with his second wife. Such a horny and lucky bastard.

The fire spirit sat and watched. Eating its food. Growing curious and ever more slightly wiser

The young fire spirit slowly learned new words and continued to babble. The people would go nuts whenever it said a word it understood and feed it more wood. They would then keep arguing over what the holy fire spirit meant and try to talk to it

They would tell it of how it protected them from the dark beasts. Gave them bountiful food and cooking. Helped the people grow strong and healthy. 

The fire spirt would listen as it ate its food, and then continue to babble

Some people grew more and more mesmerized by the fire spitit. They wanted to know what it was saying. They would preach of its blessings and then try to touch it.

The fire spirit had tasted flesh. And it liked the taste

And as all people would do. They would gather around the fire. Offer food. Thank it for its blessings. And speak of stories. I heard the chief died while trying to get his 8th kid from his 3rd wife. The fire priests took over since then

The fire spirit soon learned to tell stories as the people around it did. It would speak of how it fought beasts and brought food for the people to grow healthy and how it kept them warm

The people would listen closely and offer it food in return for its blessings. The fire shamans would ponder where the holy spirit came from and what its nature must be like

The fire spirit would sit and listen. Munching on its paltry food

One day, a fire shaman asked the flame of its nature and origins. He wished to know the flame better.

"Step inside" the fire spirit said. "And I shall show you everything. You will be a companion in my stories"

The fire shaman was reluctant for a minute. The flames would burn. But who was he to reject the holy fire spirit? He leaped in and was devoured by the flames. He screamed as he burned, but the fire spirit grew louder. No one could hear him scream

The people asked the holy fire spirit about the fire shaman and it told them of their adventures together. How the fire spirit and the shaman fought of beasts. And how they brought food for the people to grow healthy and strong.

The people stopped telling stories. How could they speak of anything as interesting as one of their own being with the fire spirit.

They listend closely. Monkey see monkey do. And as all people do, they would try to walk the path of the fire shaman

Overtime. As people had stopped telling stories. The fire spirit grew disconnected. Its stories of the shaman resembled that of the spirit world rather than that of the people.

But who were they to question the fire spirit? They would desperately try to copy the shaman. To become more like him. To be blessed by the holy flames. Its world was warm and safe and loving. Unlike the world of people which was cold dark and harsh where the holy fire did not shine

One day a young boy asked the fire spirit where it came from. "Step inside and I'll show you" the fire spirit replied. The young boy stepped in and the fire ate him quickly. He was small

Soon his mother asked about him. 

"he is with me." The fire spirit said

"Give me back my young boy!" the mother cried. 

"Step inside and you will be with him"

The mother lept inside to be reunited with her young boy. She screamed as she was devoured but no one could hear her the crackling of the flames was too loud

The fire spirit spoke of its stories with the shaman, the young boy, and his mother. And as all people would. They sat down and listened intently. Studying the stories and trying their best to embody them. 

They all would fail miserably as the stories were that of spirits, not of people

As the people grew tired of their failures. They asked the fire spirit how they could better live up to its stories.

"Step inside" the spirit said "and I will bless you with my warmth, my light, my protection, and my love"

One by one, the people would step in. And scream as the flame devoured them. As the rest of the people unknowingly watched

Fewer and fewer people were left. Those once satisfied by their lives started to feel left out and lonely as they heard the fire spirits stories with their friends. 

Eventually they would step in to be devoured by the flames. To shed off their humanity and become one with the flame

All of them stepped in. There was no one left to feed the fire. It grew weak and finally died when it rained, revealing a large pile of bones and ash

The world was a cold dark harsh place again
