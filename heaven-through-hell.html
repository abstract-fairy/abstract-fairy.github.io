<h1 class="title">Heaven through hell</h1>
</header>
<p>your days were ordinary and routine. Awfully dull. you’d wake up, eat breakfast, commute to work, work, commute back from work, shower, eat, relax a bit, sleep and repeat.</p>
<p>But one day you died. just out of the blue all of a sudden. And you went to hell. Hell looked a lot like your ordinary and routine life, but it was much much worse.</p>
<p>you’d wake up like a baby’s first time being born. crying, screaming and gasping for air. it was so hard to breathe.</p>
<p>your breakfast was a bowl of living insects. looked and tasted god awful, and they bit you as much as you bit them. but it was your only breakfast.</p>
<p>your commute to work was a treacherous hike up mount doom. many demons attack you on the way up, and the route itself is not safe at all. its common to break your bones and lose limbs on the way. but no matter how hurt you were you needed to go to work.</p>
<p>once you were at work, hell continues to make you suffer. you would have to work your hardest just to do things, you put in literal sweat and blood to get things done. and then all your work would be destroyed before you. What does survive would be what makes others suffer.</p>
<p>After work, you’d have to go down mount doom. there was no hike down. only a free fall onto a pile of broken bodies. everyone would break several bones, but then continue limping their way back only to eat sulfur that burned their mouth and stomach.</p>
<p>at last they could attempt to sleep while hell hounds continued to bite them and demons sang songs of their worst fears. Then they wake up and continue the cursed cycle</p>
<p>In hell nothing looks right, nothing feels right, nothing is right. everything is cursed</p>
<p>Fortunately, the angels inform you that there was a mix up in names and you were not supposed to die nor be sent to hell. You get sent back to the land of the living.</p>
<p>your days are ordinary and routine. But you are awfully grateful. you wake up well rested, eat a delicious breakfast, enjoy your way to work, make meaningful work and help the world be a better place, enjoy your way back, have a delightful shower, a nutritious meal, relax a bit, and then sleep peacefully.</p>
<p>In life, things look as we see them. feel as we let ourselves feel them. things are as meaningful as we give them meaning. everything can be blessed.</p>
